              Leading and managing the onboarding journey for new hires right from before they join the company until
              the end of their probation. Setting up training, tracking their overall development and providing
              developmental feedback.

              Contributing to the development of advanced tools to make the onboarding process smoother. For example, I
              spent on creating a lot of Google Drive Scripts that helped automate redundant processes like sending
              emails, grooming backlog, setting up automatic calendar invites for important training, tracking feedback
              and producing individual reports from spreadsheets.

                I was also a part of a pilot program called "incubator teams" where the new Engineers along with a new
                Product Owner worked on researching a topic that could produce high value to the company in the future.
                One such topic that I worked for, the impact of website loading and interaction speed went on successful
                and eventually converted into a track called "Web Velocity" which is currently supported by 15+ people.
